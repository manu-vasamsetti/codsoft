Welcome to my **CodSoft Internship Repository**! 👨‍💻  
This repo contains a set of mini-projects built using **Python** and **Java** as part of my internship with [CodSoft](https://www.codsoft.in/). These projects demonstrate problem-solving, GUI development, and object-oriented programming in action.

## 🧠 Projects Overview

### ✅ Task 1: To-Do List App (Java GUI)
A minimal and interactive **To-Do List desktop app** using Java Swing.

- Add, delete, mark as done
- Persistent file storage (saved tasks)
- Lightweight and easy to use

> 📍 **Tech Used:** Java, Swing GUI, OOP

---

### 🎯 Task 2: Number Guessing Game (Python)
A fun Python-based console game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within limited attempts.

- Intelligent feedback for each guess
- Tracks number of attempts
- Replay functionality

> 📍 **Tech Used:** Python (random, loops, conditionals)

---

### 🏧 Task 3: ATM Interface (Python CLI)
A CLI-based simulated **ATM system** to perform basic banking operations.

- PIN-based authentication
- Deposit, Withdraw, Balance Check
- Modular design using OOP

> 📍 **Tech Used:** Python (OOP, Input/Output)

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/manu-vasamsetti/codsoft.git
cd codsoft
```

2. **Run Any Project**
- For Python tasks:
  ```bash
  cd Task2_NumberGuess
  python number_guess.py
  ```
- For Java GUI App:
  ```bash
  cd Task1_ToDo_App
  javac ToDo.java
  java ToDo
  ```

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

### 🎨 To-Do List App (Java)
- **MVC Pattern**:
  - Model → Task list with status
  - View → Java Swing GUI
  - Controller → Event handlers (Add/Delete)

### 🎲 Number Guessing Game (Python)
- **Flow-Based Logic**:
  - Generate a random number
  - Input-Output loop with conditions
  - End on correct guess or max attempts

### 🏦 ATM Interface (Python)
- **OOP Structure**:
  - `User` Class: Balance, PIN, transactions
  - Functions: deposit(), withdraw(), authenticate()
  - Menu-driven CLI
